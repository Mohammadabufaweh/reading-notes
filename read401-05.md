# Linked Lists


**What is a Linked List**

    *  A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

    * Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array

    * Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where every node points to the next node.

**Types of Linked List**

    * Following are the various types of linked list.

        1- Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.

        2- Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.

        3- Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.


**Basic Operations**


    Following are the basic operations supported by a list.

        1- Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

        2- Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

        3- Display − Displays the complete list.

        4- Search − Searches an element using the given key.

        5- Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.

**Insertion Operation**

    * Adding a new node in linked list is a more than one step activity. We shall learn this with diagrams here. First, create a node using the same structure and find the location where it has to be inserted.


**Deletion Operation**

    Deletion is also a more than one step process. We shall learn with pictorial representation. First, locate the target node to be removed, by using searching algorithms.


**Reverse Operation**

    This operation is a thorough one. We need to make the last node to be pointed by the head node and reverse the whole linked list.
