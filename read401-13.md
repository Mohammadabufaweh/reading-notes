# Entity Relationships

- Generally the relations are more effective between tables in the database.
- we have four type of relations
1. ManyToOne Relation
2. OneToMany Relation
3. OneToOne Relation
4. ManyToMany Relation

**ManyToOne Relation**



* Many-To-One relation between entities: Where one entity (column or set of columns) is/are referenced with another entity (column or set of columns) which contain unique values. In relational databases these relations are applicable by using foreign key/primary key between table

**OneToMany Relation**



* In this relationship each row of one entity is referenced to many child records in other entity. The important thing is that child records cannot have multiple parents. In a one-to-many relationship between Table A and Table B, each row in Table A is linked to 0, 1 or many rows in Table B.

**OneToOne Relation**



* In One-To-One relationship, one item can belong to only one other item. It means each row of one entity is referred to one and only one row of another entity.

**ManyToMany Relation**



* Many-To-Many relationship is where one or more rows from one entity are associated with more than one row in other entity.

**Integration Testing in Spring**



* Spring Boot provides an easy way to write a Unit Test for Rest Controller file. With the help of SpringJUnit4ClassRunner and MockMvc, we can create a web application context to write Unit Test for Rest Controller file.
