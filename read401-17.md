# Spring Boot and OAuth2



* This guide shows you how to build a sample app doing various things with «social login» using OAuth 2.0 and Spring Boot. The samples are all single-page apps using Spring Boot and Spring Security on the back end. But, the changes needed to convert to a different JavaScript framework or to use server-side rendering would be minimal.

* There are several samples building on each other, adding new features at each step:

1. simple: a very basic static app with just a home page and unconditional login via Spring Boot’s OAuth 2.0 configuration properties (if you visit the home page, you will be automatically redirected to GitHub).

2. click: adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login.

3. logout: adds a logout link as well for authenticated users.

4. two-providers: adds a second login provider so the user can choose on the home page which one to use.

5. custom-error: adds an error message for unauthenticated users, and a custom authentication based on GitHub’s API

* Each app can be imported into an IDE. They all come up with a home page on http://localhost:8080 .

**Single Sign On With GitHub**

* Creating a New Project
* Add a Home Page

**Securing the Application with GitHub and Spring Security**

* To make the application secure, you can simply add Spring Security as a dependency.

* Next, you need to configure your app to use GitHub as the authentication provider. To achieve this, do the following:

**Add a New GitHub App**

* Select «New OAuth App» and then the «Register a new OAuth application» page is presented. The OAuth redirect URI is the path in the application that the end-user’s user-agent is redirected back to after they have authenticated with GitHub and have granted access to the application on the Authorize application page.

**Configure application.yml**
***Boot Up the Application***

* With that change, you can run your app again and visit the home page at http://localhost:8080. Now, instead of the home page, you should be redirected to login with GitHub. If you stay logged in to GitHub, you won’t have to re-authenticate with this local app, even if you open it in a fresh browser with no cookies and no cached data. It’s safe to grant access to this sample since only the app running locally can use the tokens and the scope it asks for is limited.
