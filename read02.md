## Headings
HTML has six "levels" of headings:

![phptp1](https://www.freetutorialsplus.com/html-tutorial/images/html-headings.png)

## Bold & Italic 

### Bold

By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make
characters appear bold. <b>This text is bold</b>

### Italic 

By enclosing words in the tags
<i> and </i> we can make
characters appear italic.
<i>This text is italic</i>


## Horizontal Rules `<hr />`

To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the`<hr />` tag.

## Breaks`<br />`
Line Breaks`<br />` if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag `<br />.`

## strong `<strong>`
The use of the `<strong>` element indicates that its
content has strong importance.

## emphasis `<em>`
The `<em>` element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. By default browsers will show the contents of an `<em>` element in italic.

## cite `<cite>`
When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film or research paper, the `<cite>` element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.

# CSS
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES
Here are five rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:
+ It must not start with a number.
+ Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
+ You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
+ Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
+ If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.
