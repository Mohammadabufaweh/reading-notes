# Forms


HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.


## Controlled Components
In HTML, form elements such as `<input>, <textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”



## The textarea Tag
In HTML, a `<textarea>` element defines its text by its children:

`<textarea>`
  Hello there, this is some text in a text area
`</textarea>`
In React, a `<textarea>` uses a value attribute instead. This way, a form using a `<textarea> `can be written very similarly to a form that uses a single-line input



## The file input Tag
In HTML, an <input type="file"> lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded to a server or manipulated by JavaScript via the File API.
```html
<input type="file" />
```
Because its value is read-only, it is an uncontrolled component in React. It is discussed together with other uncontrolled components later in the documentation.


## Controlled Input Null Value
Specifying the value prop on a controlled component prevents the user from changing the input unless you desire so. If you’ve specified a value but the input is still editable, you may have accidentally set value to undefined or null.
