# Transforms
With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

Within this lesson we’ll take a look at both two-dimensional and three-dimensional transforms. Generally speaking, browser support for the transform property isn’t great, but it is getting better every day. For the best support vendor prefixes are encouraged, however you may need to download the nightly version of Chrome to see all of these transforms in action.

##  Transform Syntax
The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

```css
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}
```


Notice how the transform property includes multiple vendor prefixes to gain the best support across all browsers. The un-prefixed declaration comes last to overwrite the prefixed versions, should a browser fully support the transform property.

In the interest of brevity, the remainder of this lesson will not include vendor prefixes. They are, however, strongly encouraged for any code in a production environment. Over time we will be able to remove these prefixes, however keeping them in is the safest approach for the time being.

## 2D Transforms

Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. We’ll start by discussing how to transform elements on a two-dimensional plane, and then work our way into three-dimensional transforms.

## 2D Rotate

The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. The default point of rotation is the center of the element, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically. Later we will discuss how you can change this default point of rotation.

```HTML
<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
```

              
```CSS

.box-1 {
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: rotate(-55deg);
}
```


## Rotate Demo

The gray box behind the rotated element symbolizes the original position of the element. Additionally, upon hover the box will rotate 360 degrees horizontally. As the lesson progresses, keep an eye out for the gray box within each demonstration as a reference to the element’s original position and the horizontal rotation to help demonstrate an elements alteration and depth.

## 2D Scale

Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.


```HTML
<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
```

              
```CSS

.box-1 {
  transform: scale(.75);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: scale(1.25);
}
```


## Scale Demo


It is possible to scale only the height or width of an element using the scaleX and scaleY values. The scaleX value will scale the width of an element while the scaleY value will scale the height of an element. To scale both the height and width of an element but at different sizes, the x and y axis values may be set simultaneously. To do so, use the scale transform declaring the x axis value first, followed by a comma, and then the y axis value.

```HTML
<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
<figure class="box-3">Box 3</figure>
```
              
```CSS
.box-1 {
  transform: scaleX(.5);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: scaleY(1.15);
}
.box-3 {
  transform: scale(.5, 1.15);
}
```
              
## Multiple Scaling Demo

### 2D Translate
The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document. Using the translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.

```HTML
<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
<figure class="box-3">Box 3</figure>
```

```css
.box-1 {
  transform: translateX(-10px);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: translateY(25%);
}
.box-3 {
  transform: translate(-10px, 25%);
}
```

# 3D Transforms

Working with two-dimensional transforms we are able to alter elements on the horizontal and vertical axes, however there is another axis along which we can transform elements. Using three-dimensional transforms we can change elements on the z axis, giving us control of depth as well as length and width.

## 3D Rotate

So far we’ve discussed how to rotate an object either clockwise or counterclockwise on a flat plane. With three-dimensional transforms we can rotate an element around any axes. To do so, we use three new transform values, including rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ.

```html
<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
<figure class="box-3">Box 3</figure>
```


```css

.box-1 {
  transform: perspective(200px) rotateX(45deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: perspective(200px) rotateY(45deg);
}
.box-3 {
  transform: perspective(200px) rotateZ(45deg);
}

```

## 3D Scale


By using the scaleZ three-dimensional transform elements may be scaled on the z axis. This isn’t extremely exciting when no other three-dimensional transforms are in place, as there is nothing in particular to scale. In the demonstration below the elements are being scaled up and down on the z axis, however the rotateX value is added in order to see the behavior of the scaleZ value. When removing the rotateX in this case, the elements will appear to be unchanged.

```HTML

<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
```
              
```CSS

.box-1 {
  transform: perspective(200px) scaleZ(1.75) rotateX(45deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: perspective(200px) scaleZ(.25) rotateX(45deg);
}
```

## 3D Translate

Elements may also be translated on the z axis using the translateZ value. A negative value here will push an element further away on the z axis, resulting in a smaller element. Using a positive value will pull an element closer on the z axis, resulting in a larger element.

While this may appear to be very similar to that of the two-dimensional transform scale value, it is actually quite different. The transform is taking place on the z axis, not the x or y axes. When working with three-dimensional transforms, being able to move an element on the z axis does have great benefits, like when building the cube below for example.

```HTML

<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
```
              
```CSS

.box-1 {
  transform: perspective(200px) translateZ(-50px);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: perspective(200px) translateZ(50px);
}
```
             
# Transitions & Animations


One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

Transitions
As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.

In the example below the box will change its background color over the course of 1 second in a linear fashion.

```css
.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  transition-property: background;
  transition-duration: 1s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #ff7b29;
}
```

## Transitional Property

The transition-property 
property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties. By default, all of the properties within an element’s different states will be altered upon change. However, only the properties identified within the transition-property value will be affected by any transitions.

```css
.box {
    background: #2db34a;
    border-radius: 6px
    transition-property: background, border-radius;
    transition-duration: 1s;
    transition-timing-function: linear;
  }
  .box:hover {
    background: #ff7b29;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

```

## Transition Duration

The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the transition-duration property. The value of this property can be set using general timing values, including seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). These timing values may also come in fractional measurements, .2s for example.



# 8 SIMPLE CSS3 TRANSITIONS THAT WILL WOW YOUR USERS

1. Fade in

Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients. It’s a great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action.

Fade in effects are coded in two steps: first, you set the initial state; next, you set the change
2. Change color

Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them. Now, we just set the div’s class to “color” and specify the color we want in our CSS
3. Grow & Shrink

To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding. But now we can use CSS3’s transform to enlarge.
4. Rotate elements

CSS transforms have a number of different uses, and one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element. Give your div the class “rotate” and add the following to your CSS

5. Square to circle

A really popular effect at the moment is transitioning a square element into a round one, and vice versa. With CSS, it’s a simple effect to achieve, we just transition the border-radius property

6. 3D shadow

3D shadows were frowned upon for a year or so, because they weren’t seen as compatible with flat design, which is of course nonsense, they work fantastically well to give a user feedback on their interactions and work with flat, or fake 3D interfaces

7. Swing

Not all elements use the transition property. We can also create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration.

In this case, we’ll first define a CSS animation in your styles. You’ll notice that due to implementation issues, we need to use @-webkit-keyframes as well as @keyframes (yes, Internet Explorer really is better than Chrome, in this respect at least).

8. Inset border

One of the hottest button styles right now is the ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border. We can of course add a border to an element simply, but that will change the element’s position. We could fix that problem using box sizing, but a far simpler solution is the transition in a border using an inset box shadow.
