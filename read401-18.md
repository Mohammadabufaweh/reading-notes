# Many to many relationships

- A many-to-many relationship occurs when multiple records in a table are associated with multiple records in another table. Relational database systems usually don't allow you to implement a direct many-to-many relationship between two tables. If there were many invoices with the same invoice number and one of your customers inquired about that invoice number, you wouldn't know which number they were referring to. This is one reason for assigning a unique value to each invoice.

**Example**

- Let’s say we are creating a database for a university :
  - A student can be enrolled in multiple classes 
  - A class can have many students .

- This means a student has many classes, and a class has many students.
**- so weh have to use joining table:**
- A joining table is a table that sits between the two other tables of a many-to-many relationship. Its purpose is to store a record for each of the combinations of these other two tables. It might seem like a bit of work to create, but it’s simple to do and provides a much better data structure.
