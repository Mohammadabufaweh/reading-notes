#  Room

**Room provides the following benefits:**

1. Compile-time verification of SQL queries..
1. Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
1. Streamlined database migration paths


**Defining data using Room entities**

- When you use the Room persistence library to store your app's data, you define entities to represent the objects that you want to store. Each entity corresponds to a table in the 
associated Room database, and each instance of an entity represents a row of data in the corresponding table.

**Anatomy of an entity**
You define each Room entity as a class that is annotated with @Entity. A Room entity includes fields for each column in the corresponding table in the database, including one or more columns that comprise the primary key.

**Create embedded objects**

- Sometimes, you'd like to express an entity or data object as a cohesive whole in your database logic, even if the object contains several fields. In these situations, you can use the @Embedded annotation to represent an object that you'd like to decompose into its subfields within a table. You can then query the embedded fields just as you would for other individual columns.


**Accessing data using Room DAOs**

- When you use the Room persistence library to store your app's data, you interact with the stored data by defining data access objects, or DAOs. Each DAO includes methods that offer abstract access to your app's database. At compile time, Room automatically generates implementations of the DAOs that you define.

- By using DAOs to access your app's database instead of query builders or direct queries, you can preserve separation of concerns, a critical architectural principle. DAOs also make it easier for you to mock database access when you test your app.

**Anatomy of a DAO**

- You can define each DAO as either an interface or an abstract class. For basic use cases, you should usually use an interface. In either case, you must always annotate your DAOs with @Dao. DAOs don't have properties, but they do define one or more methods for interacting with the data in your app's database.


- There are two types of DAO methods that define database interactions:

1. Convenience methods that let you insert, update, and delete rows in your database without writing any SQL code.
1. Query methods that let you write your own SQL query to interact with the database.
