# CRUD

**1.In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:**

100’s = Informational status.
200’s = Success - Request was accepted
300’s = Redirection - Requested resource isn't at the location anymore.
400’s = Client error - Client information/input is invalid.
500’s = Server error - Overwhelmed servers, unreachable servers, client requests triggering errors on the server.


**2.What is a status code 202?**

Asynchronous processing of a request - it's waiting to process

**3.What is a status code 308?**

Permanent redirect - Resource lives at a different URL and we can tell the client what it is

**4.What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?**

204 - Update that doesn't return data to a client, for example when just saving a currently edited document.

**5.What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?**

410 - Gone: Resource was deleted or moved somehow, don't know where it is.

**6.What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?**

403: Client has authorized but still doesn't have permissions to access the resource.

Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB

Dev dependency "nodemon" allows server to refresh upon making changes to the server code without having to stop/start the server

**1.Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?**

Because we'll want to change it from localhost to something else when we de
ploy our application. Setting it as a .env variable makes it easier to change later, and keeps it secret.

**2.What is middleware?**

Code that runs when the server gets a request, but before it gets passed to the routes.
**3.What does app.use(express.json()) do?**

app.use allows the server to accept middleware - this example allows the server to accept json as a body instead of a post element or git element.
**4.What does the /:id mean in a route?**

It is an id parameter passed in - the colon in front means this is a param being passed in
**5.What is the difference beween PUT and PATCH?**

PUT replaces an entire old version with a whole new version, PATCH replaces pieces of the old version with new pieces.
**6.How do you make a defalut value in a schema?**

Add a "default" key into the schema object with a set value (Example: default value of a dateJoined object could use Date.now)
**7.What does a 500 error status code mean?**

Error on the server causing the transaction to not work - it wasn't user or client fault.
**8.What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?**

Status 200 tells client everything went good, whereas Status 201 confirms a resource was created successfully.
