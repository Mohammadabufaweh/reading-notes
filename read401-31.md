#  Espresso


- The Espresso Test Recorder tool lets you create UI tests for your app without writing any test code. By recording a test scenario, you can record your interactions with a device and add assertions to verify UI elements in particular snapshots of your app. Espresso Test Recorder then takes the saved recording and automatically generates a corresponding UI test that you can run to test your app.

- Espresso Test Recorder writes tests based on the Espresso Testing framework, an API in AndroidX Test. The Espresso API encourages you to create concise and reliable UI tests based on user actions. By stating expectations, interactions, and assertions without directly accessing the underlying appâ€™s activities and views, this structure prevents test flakiness and optimizes test run speed.


- Use Espresso to write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests.

- The following code snippet shows an example of an Espresso test:

```java
@Test
public void greeterSaysHello() {
    onView(withId(R.id.name_field)).perform(typeText("Steve"));
    onView(withId(R.id.greet_button)).perform(click());
    onView(withText("Hello Steve!")).check(matches(isDisplayed()));
}
```


- The core API is small, predictable, and easy to learn and yet remains open for customization. Espresso tests state expectations, interactions, and assertions clearly without the distraction of boilerplate content, custom infrastructure, or messy implementation details getting in the way.

- Espresso tests run optimally fast! It lets you leave your waits, syncs, sleeps, and polls behind while it manipulates and asserts on the application UI when it is at rest.
