**What is functional programming ?**


Functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data


**What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function ?**


returns the same result if given the same arguments

**So how do we know if a function is pure or not ?**

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic),It does not cause any observable side effects

**What are the benefits of a pure function ?**

Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B

Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D

**What is immutability ?**

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.


**What is Referential transparency ?**

pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency


**What is a module ????????**
module is just essentially another Javascript file


**What does the word ‘require’ do ?**
It is required the other Javascript files

**How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in ?**


required the module
**What do we have to do to make a module available ?**
Exports the module
